# Agenic Lead Builder – Criteria & Prompts

This repository stores policy/config files for ICP matching, compliance detection, role classification, services mapping, prompt fragments, and the data contract used by the agent.

## Structure
- `criteria/` – ICP, compliance rules, services, roles, memberships, scoring weights
- `prompts/` – system prompts and summarization instructions
- `docs/` – data contract (JSON schema expectations)

Update these files to change behavior **without editing the bot**.
